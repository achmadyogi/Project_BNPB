Python script for flood risk management

## Inisiasi.py
This script is used for calculating flow direction and time consuming.
Time consuming is important to define iteration amount for three hours.

## Runoff.py
This script is used for calculating initial runoff. After the initial condition has been finished, 
next runoff will perform using available flow direction. The amount of iteration is derived from 
previous script.
